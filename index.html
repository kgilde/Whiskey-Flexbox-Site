  <h2 style="text-align: center;">Description</h2>
  <div class="container-description">
    <p>Whiskey is a dark distilled spirit that is made from a variety of grains, including barley, corn, rye, and wheat.
      It is distilled throughout the world, most popularly in Ireland, Scotland, the United States, Canada, and Japan.
      There are various styles of whiskey and some countries have regulations that stipulate how it is produced. Whether
      it's Irish whiskey, scotch, bourbon, or Canadian whisky, it's the most popular liquor in the world and it's used
      in
      numerous cocktail and shot recipes. Surprisingly, drinkers in India consume the most whiskey, though the country's
      own whiskey is rarely exported.</p>
  </div>

  <!--Types of Whiskey-->
  <h2 id="types" style="text-align: center;">Types</h2>
  <div class="container-types">
    <h5>Irish Whiskey</h5>
    <p>Irish whiskey has a smoother flavor than other types of whiskey. It’s made from a mash of malt, can only be
      distilled using water and caramel coloring, and must be distilled in wooden casks for at least three years. The
      result is a whiskey that’s easy to sip neat or on the rocks, though you can use Irish whiskey to make cocktails.
    </p>

    <h5>Bourbon Whiskey</h5>
    <p>An American-style whiskey, bourbon is made from corn. In fact, to be called bourbon whiskey, the spirit needs to
      be made from at least 51% corn, aged in a new oak barrel and produced in America. It has no minimum aging period
      and needs to be bottled at 80 proof or more.
    </p>

    <h5>Tennessee Whiskey</h5>
    <p>While Tennessee whiskey is technically classified as bourbon, some distillers in the state aren’t too keen on
      that. Instead, they use Tennessee whiskey to define their style. All current Tennessee whiskey producers are
      required by state law to produce their whiskeys in Tennessee and to use a filtering step known as the Lincoln
      County Process prior to aging the whiskey.</p>

    <h5 style="padding-right: 5px;">Japanese Whiskey</h5>
    <p>A little later to the game than Irish and scotch, Japanese whisky has made its mark on the spirits world for its
      high standards. Japanese whisky was created to taste as close to the scotch style as possible and uses similar
      distilling methods. It is mostly imbibed in mixed drinks or with a splash of soda.</p>

    <h5>Single Malt Whiskey</h5>
    <p>Single malt whisky needs to be made from one batch of scotch at a single distillery. Additionally, it must beaged
      for three years in oak before being bottled. The term “single malt” comes from the ingredients, as the
      mainingredient is malted barley. However, these rules did not make their way to U.S. distilleries. For example, in
      America, single malt is sometimes made from rye and not barley.

    </p>

    <h5>Blended Whiskey</h5>
    <p>Blended whiskey is exactly what the name highlights—it’s a mixture of different types of whiskey, as well as
      colorings, flavors and even other grains. These types of whiskeys are ideal for cocktails, as the process allows
      for the flavor to come through but keeps the spirit at a lower price point.</p>

    <h5>Scoth Whiskey</h5>
    <p>Scotch whisky (aka just scotch) is made in Scotland with either malt or grain. The Scots take their whisky-making
      seriously and have laws in place that distillers must follow. The spirit must age in an oak barrel for at least
      three years. Plus, each bottle must have an age statement which reflects the youngest aged whisky used to make
      that blend. This is a whisky to sip neat—it makes an excellent after-dinner drink.</p>

    <h5>Canadian Whiskey</h5>
    <p>Like scotch, Canadian whisky must be barrel-aged for at least three years. It’s lighter and smoother than other
      types of whiskey because it contains a high percentage of corn. You will find that most Canadian whiskies are made
      from corn and rye, but other may feature wheat or barley.</p>

    <h5>Rye Whiskey</h5>
    <p>Rye whiskey is made in America with at least 51% rye, while other ingredients include corn and barley. It follows
      the distilling process of bourbon. Rye that has been aged for two or more years and has not been blended is dubbed
      “straight rye whiskey.” Rye tends to have a spicier flavor than sweeter, smoother bourbon.</p>
